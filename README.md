# EDA-Data-science-jobs-India-
In this project, I have analyzed that how many data science jobs are there in India and more things. The dataset  used in my analysis is from the naukri.com website. It is an employment website where you can find jobs as per your preference. Also, according to Google Trends - This site is the most preferred job search destination in India.

<b>Overview </b> <li>I have downloaded this dataset from the Kaggle website. The data contains 12,000 rows and 5 columns.</li><li>Luckily, Our data is already cleaned. I can't get any null or missing values in our dataset.</li><li>To visually analyse the data, I also plot some graphs, tables and charts in the jupyter file by using python and its various libraries.</li><li>You will see top_jobs, Top skills required, Locations with maximum openings, average minimum job experience, and average maximum job experience</li>
<h1>Sample dataset</h1>

This is a first few rows of the dataset in which you can see their are 5 columns.

<h1>Top Jobs</h1>
As i said earlier, there are 12000 rows in our dataset out of which there are 6563 rows has a unique job roles. In simple words, the data contains total 6563 different job roles.

</p>
So, I have find top 5 jobs in accordance with the more number of job openings and here i got these 5 designations.

<h1>Top jobs along with their required skills</h1>
So far, i have found the top jobs that has a huge demand in the market. Now i want to know that what skills are required to grab that job. Like - I want to become a data analyst. So, what skills do i learn to become fit for that job role.<br>
</br>
Therefore, I have made the sunburst chart whose inner circle is divided into job roles and outer circle is containing a skills required for specific job role. You can see the chart below:

</p>
<h1>Job openings</h1>
Now, my next task was to find a number of job openings as per cities. For that, i have created a list of cities then counted the value as per job openings. Further, i removed the duplicate names that was present in our dataset. Lastly, I plotted the graph.

Additionally, i made a graph that gives more transparent visuals of job openings in accordance with cities.

<h1>Top demanding skills in data science job</h1>
According to my analysis, I found that Python, Machine learning, IT skills, SQL, Big data and few more skills has a huge demand in market. Let's have a look below:
